The value of greeting is an empty object. So it will return an empty object.



function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

sum(1, "2");
Answer: C
Here one parameter is a number and another one is a string. Thats why the output is 12



const food = ["🍕", "🍫", "🥑", "🍔"];
const info = { favoriteFood: food[0] };

info.favoriteFood = "🍝";

console.log(food);
Answer: A
Changing the info.favoriteFood property doesn't affect the food array. So, the output will show the original contents of the food array as listed above.



function sayHi(name) {
  return `Hi there, ${name}`;
}

console.log(sayHi());
Answer: B
There is no name given. Thats why it will return undefined.




let count = 0;
const nums = [0, 1, 2, 3];

nums.forEach((num) => {
  if (num) count += 1;
});

console.log(count);
Answer: C
0 is falsy, so it doesn't increment count.
1, 2, and 3 are truthy, so they each increment count by 1.
As a result, the count variable will have a value of 3.
